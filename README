My solutions for the problems on 4clojure com. Wanted to track refactorings and notes. Fell free to learn by reading my solutions. Lots of ideas on what not to do in here, but as refactoring occur they my become good answers. 

4clojure's not a game, it's for learning. Is there value in cheating from my answers? Be good!
